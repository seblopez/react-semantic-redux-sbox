# React Semantic UI Redux
This is a sandbox project to show different use cases of these 3 frameworks.
Among the different challenges solved in this page I can mention:
1. Semantic UI components used: Input, Button, Table, Grid, Icon
2. Redux-Form elements used: Form, Field, FieldArray
3. Field validations
4. Multiple FieldArray handling in a single form
5. Addition and deletion of FieldArray elements
6. Table pagination upon addition and removal of elements
7. Mass row deletion
8. Row delete confirmation using a Modal
